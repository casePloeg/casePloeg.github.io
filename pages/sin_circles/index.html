      <p>
        Follow the path of each ball and you can confirm that each one is moving
        in a straight line; yet when multiple balls are rendered they begin to
        paint a picture of a larger ball rolling around the inside of a circle.
        How can straight lines suddenly come together and create a circle?
        Notice that no matter how many balls there are, no two balls will ever
        collide.

        I believe there is educational importance in exposing students to
        interactive animation such as this one. Building intution for complex
        topics is a step that gets skipped often. Additionally, seeing straight
        lines slowly create a rotating circle has the potential to spark the
        interest of a student who was previously not impressed by the efforts of
        their teacher to introduce trigonmetry. Something such as this graph:
        <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/iwfjdrhdyr">desmos.com</a>
        provides a logically equalivalent family of sin graphs to the ones
        above, yet the animation shows an arguably more interesting result.
